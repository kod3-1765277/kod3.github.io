      <h2>I am a Paragraph</h2>
      <p id="para1">
        See, the thing about this assignment is that the user was required to write two paragraphs.
        I am the first of the two paragraphs. I am supposed to be "different" by their standards.
        I look different, but in terms of being a paragraph, I will also be a paragraph. Now, the
        user did not have any sort of explanation in terms of what content to write about, so... he
        thought writing the instructions would be fun. Welp, this is it. Cheerio!

      <h2>I am a Paragraph, too!</h2>
      <p id="para2">
        Ah, I see you have returned. I understand you must seriously be bored to voluntarily read
        this second paragraph. Seriously, do you not have more work to do? I mean reading me is
        different than simply skimming over me to check if I actually have a different font. Why
        put in so much effort? The user learned to have fun with this assignment, can you not do the
        same? Anyway, I applaud you for your efforts and thank you for getting to know me.
